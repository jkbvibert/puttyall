# puttyall
Grabs every host of a specified cluster from an internal API and opens up a PuTTY connection using my putty SSH key for every host.

Has the commented out capability of automatically resizing each window to fit on a single computer monitor.

Also is able to run any input commands on each host automatically, saving tons of time.
